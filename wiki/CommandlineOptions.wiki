= Commandline Options =

As comment at [http://www.jabaco.org/board/463-new-version/thread1.html http://www.jabaco.org/board/463-new-version/thread1.html] the undocumented Commandline Options for Jabaco 1.5.2:


{{{
Jabaco.exe [-projectpath | -d | -log | -jabacoframework | -javaframework]
  -projectpath : The name of the main project file. It can be either
          a .jba or .jsrc file
  -d : The directory where the binary .class files will be created
  -log : The directory where the logfile "build.log" will be created.
          If it is not set, then the logfile will be in the directory which
          was set with the  "-d" option
  -jabacoframework : Jar-Archive of the Jabaco Framework.
          If it is not set, it is Jabaco.jar in the Jabaco-directory.
  -javaframework : Jar-Archive of the Java Framework.
          If it is not set, it is the default rt.jar in the Java-directory.
}}}

To run _not_ the IDE, it is needed that "-projectpath" and "-d" are set.
The other options can also be used for the IDE. If you want to use an other Jabaco Framework file  you can set it with "-jabacoframework" and the IDE will use it.
